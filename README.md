# div_curl
The codes accompanying the paper "Cross-covariance functions for divergence-free and curl-free tangent vector fields on the sphere"

## Dependencies
The codes are written in Matlab R2014a with Financial Toolbox installed. They also depend on the following packages written by other researchers.

* RBFSPHERE Matlab package http://math.boisestate.edu/~wright/montestigliano/index.html
* MEALPix 3.0 (The original link is broken)
* subtightplot http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/39664-subtightplot
* Binned Scatter Plot http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/19506-binned-scatter-plot

*To ensure compatibility, the latter three packages are already included in this repository.*
